## 🚀 Overview

Welcome to **People on the Move**! This project is an interactive, scroll-based web presentation created for a university oral report on Demography and Migration. Built as a creative and technical alternative to traditional slideshow software like PowerPoint, it uses modern web technologies to create an engaging and narrative-driven experience.

The goal was to present complex academic topics in a dynamic and visually appealing format, proving that code can be a powerful tool for storytelling and education. (And also, I was too lazy to make a PowerPoint presentation, so I coded one instead! AHAHA)

## ✨ Features

Here are some of the cool things this project can do:

* **Scroll-Snapping Slides:** A smooth, full-screen, slide-by-slide experience controlled by scrolling.
* **Advanced Navigation Suite:**
    * **Table of Contents Modal:** A popup menu for quick access to all sections.
    * **Quick-Nav Grid:** A visual grid of all slides for at-a-glance navigation.
    * **Dynamic Dot Navigation:** A side-nav that tracks progress and allows for jumping between slides.
    * **Presenter Tracking:** A persistent tag that shows which group member is presenting the current slide.
* **Keyboard & Button Controls:** Navigate using arrow keys, home/end keys, or on-screen buttons.
* **Fully Responsive Design:** A seamless viewing experience on any device, from mobile to desktop.
* **Polished UI:** A clean, modern interface built with Tailwind CSS and enhanced with Font Awesome icons.
